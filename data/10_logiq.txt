LOGIQ General Imaging. LOGIQTM ultrasound systems offers radiology, vascular, breast, interventional, MSK, cardiac, and OB/GYN applications. LOGIQTM ultrasound systems help you care for a wide range of patients. Our systems facilitate accurate diagnoses while supporting efficient workflow, and draw on the latest security technologies to help you maintain data privacy and repel cyber threats. The LOGIQ E10 Ultrasound provides comprehensive tools to enhance precision images to treat a wide range of patients across a broad spectrum of conditions. 2D Shear Wave Elastography Enhances the clinician’s ability for quantitative assessment of tissue elasticity. Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound Helps clinicians clearly visualize tissue structure and lesion vascularity for confidence in lesion detection and characterization.3D GPS/Fusion Imaging technology assists the guidance of first needle placement so it may not be necessary to reposition the ablation probe to achieve clean margins, potentially reducing exam time and stress. B-Flow™ Imaging Provides direct, real-time visualization of blood flow echoes.Remote Control, B-Flow™ Imaging allows the LOGIQ E10 system to be operated remotely to enable concise workflow and ergonomics. Especially useful in interventional procedures, B-Flow™ Imaging helps improve efficiency and patient experience. Photo Assistant, Our new application for Android devices enables clinicians to photograph relevant anatomy – such as ulcerations, redness, or swelling – during a study. This visual can be included with the clinical images in the patient study to provide valuable context for diagnostic and treatment decisions. Scan Assistant:  Provides customizable automation to assist users helping to reduce keystrokes and exam times. Compare Assistant: Enables clinicians to easily import a patient’s prior ultrasound study view it alongside a current image in real time via a split screen on the monitor.
